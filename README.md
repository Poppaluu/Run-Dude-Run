# Run-Dude-Run
Repository for OSS course in the ITM major project. The purpose is for students to test the GitHub workflow

For developing the game, you will need Node.js. Please refer to the guide found: https://nodejs.org/en 

When the project is open for you, check that the node is correctly installed by running the code "node -v" and "npm -v" in the terminal.

Once the correct installation has been checked, first run "npm install" and then "npm run dev". This starts a local server in the address "http://localhost:5173/"
